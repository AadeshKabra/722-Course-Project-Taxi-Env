The objective of the project is to evaluate the performance of Hierarchical and Classical planning and acting strategies in the Taxi-v3 environment. The project will compare HTN Run-Lookahead and HTN Run-Lazy-Lookahead acting strategies using GTPyhop and Classical Planning approach.

The project would address the following research questions:
• 1. Does hierarchical task decomposition provide computational advantage over classical planning?
• 2. How does the choice of acting strategy affect planning efficiency?
• 3. Which factors enable planning to scale effectively as grid size increases?
